# Word-Guess-Game

## About 
This word guess game is a simple version of hangman. A random word will be chosen and the user will
have to guess the word before they run out of guesses.

## How to Play:
All that needs to be done is start clicking keys on your keyboard. Letters will fill in empty spaces if they are correct to help steer you in the right direction. The game will automatically reset
on both wins and losses.

* Html/CSS
* javascript

## Difficulties Faced
It was difficult for me to get the empty spaces to show correctly as well as having the game reset properly once the player had won or lost. I spent hours looking at my code and for help online before I found a solution. Now it works great!
